## App Review Notes
This app connects to third-party sales platform APIs (LemonSqueezy, Gumroad, Stripe) using API keys provided by the user. No demo account is available — the app requires the user's own API key from at least one provider. The app does not process payments; it only reads sales data.

To test: Enter any valid LemonSqueezy, Gumroad, or Stripe API key in Settings. The app will fetch and display the user's sales data from that platform.
